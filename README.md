COP3330 Assignment 2 (Eclipse)

That last problem was confusing, I am not familiar with how to print out the scores in a tabular format, and trying to find the average was very confusing. Sorry I couldn't finish, but it was definitely eye opening as to how to work Eclipse, Github, and even how to code in Java better. Thank you for the lesson!
